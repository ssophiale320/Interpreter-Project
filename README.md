# Interpreter-Project
This project implements an interpreter for a very simple arithmetic language whose features include:
- Integer values
- Mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and ternary if-then-else
- Variables which can be initialized and modified by assignment

Expressions are presented to the interpreter, from standard input, in postfix notation. The interpreter analyzes the expressions, one line at a time, and produces their infix notation as a string, along with the evaluated result of the expression.
